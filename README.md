# Unmanned-Air-Vehicles-UAV-Simulator-for-Placement-userAssociation-and-Power-Allocation

This is a code package is related to the follow scientific article:

Zeeshan Kaleem et. al.,, “Prioritized User-Association for Sum-Rate Maximization in UAV-Assisted Emergency Communication: A ReinforcementLearning Approach,” _Drones_, vol. xx, no. xx, pp. xx, January 2022.

This code package is licensed under the GPLv3 license. If you in any way use this code for research that results in publications, please cite our original article listed above.

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that can reproduces some of the figures in the article after doing some modifications in that code. This code will help in starting research in UAV 3D placement, power allocation, user association using Machine learning approach and can easily be modified for Deep learning algorithms.
