# Unmanned-Air-Vehicles-UAV-Simulator-for-Placement-and-Power-Allocation-

This is a code package is related to the follow scientific article:

Zeeshan Kaleem et. al.,, “Prioritized User-Association for Sum-Rate Maximization inUAV-Assisted Emergency Communication: A ReinforcementLearning Approach,” _Drones_, vol. xx, no. xx, pp. xx, January 2022.

The package contains a simulation environment, based on Matlab, that can reproduces some of the figures in the article after doing some modifications in that code. We encourage you to also perform reproducible research!
